# EL2320_AppliedEstimation
This is the lab exercise on the course EL2320 Applied Esitimation in KTH.
There are 3 labs, 

1. Kalman Filter

2. Particle Filter

3. Project: 


This report is the results of the project assignment on the course Applied Estimation in KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. A EKF-SLAM, Extended Kalman Filter for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, is used for a robot with range- only measurement data. The data we used in this report is from the Robotics Institute in Carnegie Mellon University.
